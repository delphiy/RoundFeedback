# RoundFeedback
Android Developer Task

1 -  I added three rounds files into assets/rounds folder. You can easily add new .csv files to assets/rounds folder. <br />
2 -  You can swipe left or right to see all rounds.<br />
3 -  I added RealtimeScrolling activity to show that the app will support real time capture .   This feature is good because it allows coach to see live progress during the training.<br />
4 -  The app include progress bar .The number on the left counts down the seconds left in the rest, whilst the progress bar shows how far through the rest period it is. <br />
5-   I did not use any Threads in the app.<br />
6-   I did not rename all GUI components.<br />
